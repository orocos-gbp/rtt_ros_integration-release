    rtt_roscomm: fixed compilation of service plugins with Clang
  * rtt_roscomm: add rtt_roscomm namespace for rosservice plugins and helper classes
  * rtt_roscomm: fixed compilation of service plugins with Clang (regression from https://github.com/orocos/rtt_ros_integration/pull/123)
    Clang seems to handle SFINAE differently than gcc and compilation of generated service proxy plugins failed with errors like:
    In file included from rtt_diagnostic_msgs/diagnostic_msgs_service_proxies/rtt_rosservice_proxies.cpp:7:
    rtt_roscomm/rtt_rosservice_proxy.h:99:30: error: implicit instantiation of undefined template 'ROSServiceServerOperationCallerWrapper<diagnostic_msgs::AddDiagnostics, 1>'
  * rtt_roscomm: replace add_file_dependencies() macro call by a custom target
    Fixes build issues with parallel builds. If multiple targets depend on the same generated header file,
    the file gets generated more than once, too (with CMake 3.5 in Ubuntu xenial).
    Each invocation of the compiler might therefore see an inconsistent state of the generated header file
    if another process associated with another target is about to overwrite the same file. The solution is
    to replace the file-level dependencies by an explicit rtt-package-generate_boost_headers custom target
    that all library targets depend on.
    The dependencies on the current CMake list file (CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE) are not required because if
    the file would change, cmake needs to run again and is normally executed automatically. If not, the
    file dependency does not help either because the contents of the generated source files did not change.
    Changes in upstream message or service definitions (.msg or .srv files) are already covered by the
    declared dependencies of the generated boost headers or the implicit target dependency from including
    the generated service headers.

  * fix the build correctly

  * rtt_roscomm/rtt_std_srvs: add wrappers for common operation signatures to rtt_std_srvs (fix #101 <https://github.com/orocos/rtt_ros_integration/issues/101>)
    With this patch it is possible to create ROS service servers for some common operation signatures out of the box,
    without the need to write custom wrappers or to add extra operations with the ROS specific callback signature.
    Supported service types and associated signatures:
    std_srvs/Empty:
    - bool empty()                     // The service call fails if empty() returns false!
    // Use std_srvs/Trigger if the result should be returned as the response.
    - void empty()
    std_srvs/SetBool:
    - bool setBool(bool, std::string &message_out)
    - bool setBool(bool)               // response.message will be empty
    - std::string setBool(bool)        // response.success = true
    - void setBool(bool)               // response.success = true and response.message will be empty
    std_srvs/Trigger:
    - bool trigger(std::string &message_out)
    - bool trigger()                   // response.message will be empty
    - std::string trigger()            // response.success = true
    The approach can be easily extended to other ROS service types.

  * rtt_roscomm: fixed retrieval of fully-qualified topic in RubPubChannelElement/RosSubChannelElement
    ROS graph names cannot be simply concatenated, e.g. if the topic name is already fully qualified
    (starts with a /). Another broken case were private publishers or subscribers, where the topic
    passed by the user starts with a tilde (~) and the constructor uses the private node handle.
    Luckily ros::Publisher and ros::Subscriber already provide a getTopic() method which returns the
    fully-qualified topic in all these cases.
