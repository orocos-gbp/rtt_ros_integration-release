ros-noetic-rtt-dynamic-reconfigure (2.9.0-1buster) buster; urgency=high

  * rtt_dynamic_reconfigure: create a partially filled PropertyBag from a Config message that only has a subset of fields
  * rtt_dynamic_reconfigure: support both, non-const and const updateProperties callback signatures
    This is an improved version of https://github.com/orocos/rtt_ros_integration/pull/81 that is backwards-compatible
    to existing components that provide the const-variant of the callback.
  * rtt_dynamic_reconfigure: allow the update callback to change the values in the propertybag
    This fixes a thread-safety issue with the previous commit b603585e9f74b3a553347301b44c73b0249856a1.
    But the user-defined update callback has to update the referenced bag manually in case it modified
    some property values.
  * rtt_dynamic_reconfigure: publish updated property values in setConfigCallback() instead of desired once
    Rebuild new_config ConfigType from owner's PropertyBag before serializing and publishing dynamic_reconfigure msg from PropertyBag.
    The user might have modified the property values in one of the callbacks.
  * rtt_dynamic_reconfigure: fixed potential deadlock in refresh() for RTT prior to 2.9
    We do not know for sure which thread is calling this method/operation, but we can check if the current
    thread is the same as the thread that will process the update/notify operation. If yes, we clone the
    underlying OperationCaller implementation and set the caller to the processing engine. In this case
    RTT <2.9 should always call the operation directly as if it would be a ClientThread operation:
    https://github.com/orocos-toolchain/rtt/blob/toolchain-2.8/rtt/base/OperationCallerInterface.hpp#L79
    RTT 2.9 and above already checks the caller thread internally and therefore does not require this hack.
  * Added individual changelogs and bumped versions to 2.9.0

ros-noetic-rtt-dynamic-reconfigure (2.8.6-1buster) buster; urgency=high

  * rtt_dynamic_reconfigure: fix a bug that duplicate ids when generating a parameter description from a property tree
    The id field of each groups in a dynamic_reconfigure/ConfigDescription message must be unique and some groups
    might reference another as their parent. Without this patch the ids were assigned locally and were only unique within
    the same group, which confused rqt_reconfigure and the dynparam console client when they try to rebuild the tree
    hierarchy in more complex cases.
